Place test data files in this folder

Reference the files via relative path

For example, if you had a file called `usercredentials.json`, reference it in java via
`new File('testdata/usercredentials.json`.

Please ensure that you always use a relative path from the project folder, otherwise your tests will fail on our servers and will not be approved.
